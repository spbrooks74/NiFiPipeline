# NiFiPipeline
I practice performing ETL on a database that contains information about some movies by constructing NiFi pipelines that act first on an Excel file and then on a MySQL database. 
In the first part, I constructed a NiFi pipeline to move data from an Excel file to a .csv file. 
In the second part, I move the data from a .csv file to a MySQL database using a NiFi pipeline.
